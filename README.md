The entire programming was done on the IDLE editor on windows platform.
I am attaching the Zip folder containg the readme file, Report, and the server and client python file. 
Kindly extract all the contents first.

Select the edit with IDLE by clicking on the python file and select the RUN MODULE option to run the program.
The Server should be running first to receive the messages fom the Client end.

The Client end should be run only after the Server is run.
